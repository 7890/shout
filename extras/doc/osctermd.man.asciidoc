OSCTERMD(1)
===========
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
osctermd - prints strings received as OSC messages to terminal

SYNOPSIS
--------
*osctermd* [-h | --help] | [OSC PORT]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
osctermd takes an optional *OSC PORT* argument.
If no port is given, osctermd will start on port *7770*

OSC messages with the the pattern /display s "my string"
are processed.

To suppress osctermd to output a newline '\n' after every
received string, the following pattern can be used:
/display si "my partial string without newline" 0

oscterm runs as long as it is not killed (CTRL+C received).

osctermd will reset the terminal when finished to avoid any 
effects from previously sent escape sequences (like cursor off).

EXAMPLES
--------

Terminal 1::
	$ osctermd

Terminal 2::
	$ oscsend localhost 7770 /display s "hi"

Terminal 2::
	$ oscsend localhost 7770 /display si "h" 0
