when a character was changed or new characters were added:

simply concatenate all characters to one file and gzip -9 it:

cd fonts
cat c64_extended_single/_* | gzip -9 > c64_extended.spf.gz

the new c64_extended.spf.gz will be used by make

c64_extended.spf is based on c64.bdf (8x8 pixel font)

the bdf file was converted with bdf2spf
thanks to robin@gareus.org for providing a starting point for the bdf reader
